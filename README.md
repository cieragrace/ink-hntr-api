# ink-hntr-api

As a resident of Denver, I am well aware of the abundance of talent in the local tattoo scene. Whether you're new to the city, searching for a new artist, or getting your first tattoo, the process of finding the right artist can feel overwhelming. Even recommending an artist to someone can be daunting. That's where our app comes in. Using keywords, users can sort through top-tier tattoo artists in the Denver area, all of whom work at shops with over 4.5 star Google ratings. Users can click on an artist's name to access their shop information, Instagram link, and a small collection of their work directly on the site.

This is the API for the APP
